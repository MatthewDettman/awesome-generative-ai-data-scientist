# Python Libraries (GenAI and LLMs)

## AI LLM Frameworks

- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): A framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph): A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows.
- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index): LlamaIndex is a framework for building context-augmented generative AI applications with LLMs.
- [LlamaIndex Workflows](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/introducing-workflows-beta-a-new-way-to-create-complex-ai-applications-with-llamaindex): LlamaIndex workflows is a mechanism for orchestrating actions in the increasingly-complex AI application we see our users building.

## LLM Models

- [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-python): The official Python library for the OpenAI API
- [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/models): Open LLM models by Meta, Mistral, and hundreds of other providers
- [Anthropic Claude SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python): The official Python library for the Anthropic API
- [Meta Llama Models](https://llama.meta.com/): The open source AI model you can fine-tune, distill and deploy anywhere.
- [Google Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-python): The official Python library for the Google Gemini API
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama): Get up and running with large language models locally.
