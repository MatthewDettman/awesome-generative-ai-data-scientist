# Python Libraries for GenAI

## AI LLM Frameworks

- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): A framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph): A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows.
- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index): LlamaIndex is a framework for building context-augmented generative AI applications with LLMs.
- [LlamaIndex Workflows](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/introducing-workflows-beta-a-new-way-to-create-complex-ai-applications-with-llamaindex): LlamaIndex workflows is a mechanism for orchestrating actions in the increasingly-complex AI application we see our users building.


## Vector Databases

- [ChromaDB](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma): The fastest way to build Python or JavaScript LLM apps with memory!
